# Dayton PS220 Transmission Line

This speaker is a folded transmission line tuned to approx. 45Hz. Nothing exotic about the design, the pipe is not tapered so the cross sectional area is the same as the cone area throughout.

Dayton PS220-8 is mounted at one end of the labyrinth and there is also mounted a tweeter, I believe it may be the Aurum Cantus G2si but I remember the sensitivity spec being a lot lower than what is shown for the G2si. I wanted this speaker to be as full-range as I could make it, but found early on that the beaming caused by the woofer alone made for an unenjoyable listening experience so I added the tweeter. It's crossed over kind of high with just a capacitor in series, like 3k - 4k I think, and just helps with dispersion a bit.

The woofer has no passive crossover network, it is running completely full range.
